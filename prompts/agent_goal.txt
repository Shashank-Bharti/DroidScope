Explore the {app_name} application like a human user.
Open primary tabs, menus, feeds, profiles, and settings naturally.
Interact with the interface by tapping, scrolling, and opening context menus to understand how users browse and consume content.
Avoid destructive or irreversible actions such as logout, account deletion, blocking, posting, or sending messages.
Navigate as deeply as possible to discover screens reachable through taps, long-presses, or secondary menus.
Prefer breadth-first exploration before going deeper into a single flow.
Do not attempt to complete tasks or goals; focus only on structural navigation.
Record each distinct UI state as a screen with a unique identifier, descriptive name, and navigation depth.
Record every navigation change as a transition with source screen, destination screen, and the action performed.
Continue exploration until maximum reasonable depth is reached or no new screens are discovered.
Generate a complete markdown containing screens, transitions, total screen count, maximum depth, and exploration time.
Export the generated markdown data to a `.md` file.
Output markdown only.
